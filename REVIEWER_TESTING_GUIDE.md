# GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here
```

### Step 3: Start All Services
```bash
# Start all services at once
pnpm dev

# Or start individually:

# pnpm dev:whisper   # Port 8000
```

### Step 4: Verify Services Are Running
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173
- **Backend**: http://localhost:3000 (should show "Poll Generation API is running")
- **Whisper**: http://localhost:8000 (Python service)

```

### 🎤 Audio Processing Testing

#### Test 4: Audio Upload and Processing
```bash
# 1. Login as host
# 2. Navigate to "Live Meeting" tab
# 3. Click "AI Audio Recording"
# 4. Record audio for 10-15 seconds (or upload WAV file)
# 5. Click "Stop Recording" or "Upload"
# ✅ Should show processing indicator
# ✅ Should display transcription results

```

#### Test 5: Real-time Audio Streaming
```bash
# 1. In host dashboard, click "Connect to Meeting"
# 2. Note the meeting ID
# 3. Click "Start Audio Stream"
# 4. Speak into microphone for 30 seconds
# ✅ Should show real-time transcription updates
# ✅ Should generate polls every 5 seconds
# ✅ Check browser console for WebSocket messages
```

### 👥 Multi-User Testing

#### Test 6: Host-Participant Flow
```bash
# Setup:
# 1. Open two browser windows/tabs
# 2. Window 1: Login as "Meeting Host"
# 3. Window 2: Login as "Participant"

# Host (Window 1):
# 1. Go to "Live Meeting"
# 2. Click "Connect to Meeting"
# 3. Note the meeting ID
# 4. Generate some polls (via audio or manual)
# 5. Launch a poll to participants

# Participant (Window 2):
# 1. Go to "Join Meeting"
# 2. Enter the meeting ID from host
# 3. Join the meeting
# 4. Answer the poll when it appears
# ✅ Host should see participant responses in real-time
```

### 🎨 UI/UX Testing

#### Test 7: Responsive Design
```bash
# 1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
# 2. Toggle device toolbar (mobile view)
# 3. Test different screen sizes:
#    - Mobile: 375px width
#    - Tablet: 768px width  
#    - Desktop: 1200px width
# ✅ UI should adapt properly to all sizes
# ✅ Navigation should work on mobile
# ✅ Forms should be usable on small screens
```

#### Test 8: Navigation and Routing
```bash
# Test all navigation paths:
# 1. Landing page → Sign up → Host dashboard
# 2. Host dashboard → Live Meeting → Audio Recording
# 3. Host dashboard → Participants → Leaderboard
# 4. Sign out → Sign in → Participant interface
# ✅ All routes should work without errors
# ✅ Protected routes should redirect to login
```

### 🔧 Technical Testing

#### Test 9: API Endpoints
```bash
# Test backend APIs directly:
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/
# ✅ Should return "Poll Generation API is running"

curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"api-test@example.com","password":"Test123!","role":"host"}'
# ✅ Should return success response with user data
```

#### Test 10: WebSocket Connectivity
```bash
# 1. Open browser console (F12)

# Test production builds
pnpm build

# Should build successfully:
# ✅ Frontend build completes without errors
# ✅ Backend TypeScript compiles successfully
# ✅ No type errors or warnings
```

## 🐛 Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Port Already in Use
```bash
# Solution: Kill existing processes
# Windows:
netstat -ano | findstr :5173
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# Linux/Mac:
lsof -ti:5173 | xargs kill -9
```

### Issue 2: Dependencies Not Installing
```bash
# Solution: Clean install
rm -rf node_modules
rm pnpm-lock.yaml
pnpm install
```

### Issue 3: WebSocket Connection Failed
```bash
# Check:
# 1. Backend is running on port 3000
# 2. No firewall blocking connections
# 3. Browser console for specific error messages
```

### Issue 4: Audio Recording Not Working
```bash
# Check:
# 1. Browser permissions for microphone
# 2. HTTPS required for microphone access (use localhost)
# 3. Whisper service running on port 8000
```

## 📊 Performance Testing

### Test 12: Load Testing
```bash
# 1. Open multiple browser tabs (5-10)
# 2. Login different users in each tab
# 3. Join same meeting from all tabs
# 4. Submit poll responses simultaneously
# ✅ Should handle multiple users without crashes
# ✅ Real-time updates should work for all users
```

### Test 13: Memory and CPU Usage
```bash
# 1. Open browser task manager
# 2. Monitor memory usage during:
#    - Audio recording
#    - Real-time streaming
#    - Multiple poll generations
# ✅ Memory usage should be reasonable (<500MB)
# ✅ No memory leaks during extended use
```
